    infinite mean the animation continues forever.

    Without alternate:     
    After the animation completes its forward progress (from black to transparent), it
    immediately jumps back to the starting point of the animation (black border).
     This abrupt change can make it look like the border is disappearing and 
     reappearing quickly.
     So instead of doing that, it doesnt show the border twice in a row.
